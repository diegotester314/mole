# **Welcome to Mole**

Mole is a tool to assist with testing and experimentation involving robots and autonomous systems. It can facilitate the following:

* **test and experiment execution**: tracking who, what, where, when, why, and how of the experiment
* **data collection**: acquiring targeted data based on *events* representing "conditions of interest"
* **orchestration**: controlling experiment infrastructure to enable dyamic yet repeatable scenarios
* **monitoring**: confirming system, infrastructure, and personnel status over time
* **analysis and reporting**: generating pre-defined performance metrics and figures to rapidly produce stakeholder reports

Mole originated as a way to collect data for uncrewed ground vehicles and to automatically generate reports with summary metrics and figures.  It now finds a number of additional use cases spanning single and multi-vehicle operations within air, ground, and sea domains -- both live and virtual.

This documentation seeks to provide sufficient background to enable using Mole or contributing to its development.
